# Models 
1. db is added in project settings
2. new models are specified in rango app 
3. new migration script is created - python script that uses ORM to create SQL tables 
4. the migration script is run to create tables in the db
5. add models to admin.py - to preview them in admin interface
6. create population script

Thinking hurts, but it is better than doing lots of grunt work!
